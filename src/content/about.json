    "bio": [
      "I love helping students discover what they're capable of. Even a small boost in confidence can make a big difference, and I find real joy in supporting students as they begin to trust their own abilities. Watching someone achieve something they didn’t think was possible is one of the most rewarding parts of teaching.",
      "Sharing my enthusiasm for STEM is just as important. I've always been drawn to math and science because they help explain how the world works and offer tools to build something new. These subjects also provide a foundation for solving real-world problems and making meaningful change.",
      "Outside of teaching, I’m a lifelong reader and always have a book with me. I also started sewing during my PhD, and it quickly became a favourite creative outlet. I love the process of turning a flat piece of fabric into a finished garment — it’s a satisfying blend of structure and imagination."
