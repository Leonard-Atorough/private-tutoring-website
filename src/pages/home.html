         Hi, I’m Person-an independent tutor with a passion for helping students build confidence and clarity in their
         learning.I started tutoring while studying at university, and quickly discovered how rewarding it was to see
         students go from “I don’t get this” to “I’ve got this.” Since then, I’ve worked with learners of all ages, from
         primary school to adult education, tailoring each session to fit their goals and learning style. Whether you're
         preparing for exams, catching up on coursework, or just want to feel more confident in a subject, I’m here to
         help. My approach is friendly, flexible, and focused on making progress feel achievable. If you’re curious
         about working together, feel free to reach out—I’d love to hear what you’re working on.
      </p>
