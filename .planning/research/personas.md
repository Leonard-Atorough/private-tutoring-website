## Anti-Persona: Who We Don't Serve

### The "Quick Fix" Seeker
- Expects the tutor to "do the work" for their child

- Focused solely on short-term grade manipulation
- Unrealistic expectations (e.g., "Can you guarantee an A?")

**Why**: Our focus is on sustainable learning and skill development, not shortcuts or academic dishonesty.

## How to Use These Personas

### In Design Decisions
- **Ask**: "Would Sarah be able to find pricing easily?" "Would Alex find the mobile experience frustrating?"

### In Feature Prioritization
- **Example**: Student portal benefits Alex and Maya more than Sarah (parents prefer email updates)

### In Marketing Copy
- **Example**: Emphasize "affordable packages" for The Johnsons, "expert SAT strategies" for Alex

### In User Testing
- **Recruit**: Participants matching these personas for usability tests
